- **Null Checks**: Implements robust null checks throughout the application to handle scenarios where no file is uploaded, resulting in a seamless and error-free user experience.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is built using React Bootstrap, providing a responsive and mobile-friendly user interface, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices.
